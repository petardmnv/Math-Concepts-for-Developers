    "### 1. Perlin Noise\n",
    "This algorithm has many applications in computer graphics and can serve to demonstrate several things... and help us learn about math, algorithms and Python :).\n",
    "#### Noise\n",
    "Noise is just random values. We can generate noise by just calling a random generator. Note that these are actually called *pseudorandom generators*. We'll talk about this later in this course.\n",
    "We can generate noise in however many dimensions we want. For example, if we want to generate a single dimension, we just pick N random values and call it a day. If we want to generate a 2D noise space, we can take an approach which is similar to what we already did with `np.meshgrid()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{noise}(x, y) = N, N \\in [n_{min}, n_{max}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes two coordinates and returns a single number N between $n_{min}$ and $n_{max}$. (This is what we call a \"scalar field\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables are always connected to **distributions**. We'll talk about these a great deal but now let's just say that these define what our noise will look like. In the most basic case, we can have \"uniform noise\" - that is, each point in our little noise space $[n_{min}, n_{max}]$ will have an equal chance (probability) of being selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perlin noise\n",
    "There are many more distributions but right now we'll want to have a look at a particular one. **Perlin noise** is a kind of noise which looks smooth. It looks cool, especially if it's colored. The output may be tweaked to look like clouds, fire, etc. 3D Perlin noise is most widely used to generate random terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "... Now you're on your own :). Research how the algorithm is implemented (note that this will require that you understand some other basic concepts like vectors and gradients).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your task\n",
    "1. Research about the problem. See what articles, papers, Python notebooks, demos, etc. other people have created\n",
    "2. Create a new notebook and document your findings. Include any assumptions, models, formulas, etc. that you're using\n",
    "3. Implement the algorithm. Try not to copy others' work, rather try to do it on your own using the model you've created\n",
    "4. Test and improve the algorithm\n",
    "5. (Optional) Create a cool demo :), e.g. using Perlin noise to simulate clouds. You can even do an animation (hint: you'll need gradients not only in space but also in time)\n",
    "6. Communicate the results (e.g. in the Softuni forum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: [This](http://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html) is a very good resource. It can show you both how to organize your notebook (which is important) and how to implement the algorithm."
